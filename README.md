#  All Trails at Lunch

- Developed using Xcode 15.1 
- Tested on iPhone 13 Pro Sim + iPhone 13 Pro Max device running iOS 15.1.1 with system light theme
- No third party libraries used
- Combine + Mapkit from Apple are used

### Known Issues
- Occassionally some user input will cause a crash when creating URLQueryItem. Will need to sanitize input
- In order to get to the initial result of closest restaurants to current location, you'll need to quit the app and reopen. Will need to implement a button of somekind to get you to the initial result or pull to refresh


### Major TODO's
- Error Scenarios (Denying Location, Errors fetching from network)
- Loading spinner
